### Data Preprocessing
Three-dimensional structures of proteins are stored in two compressed files, prot_3d_for_Davis.tar.gz, and prot_3d_for_kiba.tar.gz.
You should move to the folder **data**, and run these commands:
```
cd davis
tar â€“xvzf prot_3d_for_Davis.tar.gz
```
and 
```
cd kiba
tar -xvzf prot_3d_for_kiba.tar.gz
```
Then, you can run:
```
python3 process_protein_3d.py --data {data_name} --device cuda:0
```
here, data_name is in {kiba, davis}.
### Training Binding Affinity Prediction 
You can run:
```
python3 train_binding_affinity.py --data {data_name} --fold_idx {fold_idx}
```
data_name is in {kiba, davis} and fold_idx should be in {0,1,2,3,4}.

### Training Ligand Generation
We provide a checkpoint for pre-trained unconditional VAEs. You can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NWtaokYSxmYvt7u2UbdiHfGlD4DeRxVQ/view?usp=sharing). 

Then, the downloaded file should be placed in the same directory as the train_vae.py file.

You can run:
```
python3 train_vae.py
```
### Sampling and Evaluation
You can run:
```
python3 generate_ligand.py --num_mols 100
```

abstract  ="Accurate prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) in silico is of critical importance for modern drug discovery. Computational methods of DTA prediction{,} applied in the early stages of drug development{,} are able to speed it up and cut its cost significantly. A wide range of approaches based on machine learning were recently proposed for DTA assessment. The most promising of them are based on deep learning techniques and graph neural networks to encode molecular structures. The recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction made by AlphaFold made an unprecedented amount of proteins without experimentally defined structures accessible for computational DTA prediction. In this work{,} we propose a new deep learning DTA model 3DProtDTA{,} which utilises AlphaFold structure predictions in conjunction with the graph representation of proteins. The model is superior to its rivals on common benchmarking datasets and has potential for further improvement."}
